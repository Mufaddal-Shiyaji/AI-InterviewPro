1. add more varied training data and target values


things that could potentially improve:

1. use larger datasets
2. use more target features of the datasets like 

Prolongation: Elongated syllable (e.g., M[mmm]ommy)
Block: Gasps for air or stuttered pauses
Sound Repetition: Repeated syllables (e.g., I [pr-pr-pr-]prepared dinner)
Word Repetition: The same word or phrase is repeated (e.g., I made [made] dinner)
No Stuttered Words: Confirmation that none of the above is true.
Interjection: Common filler words such as "um" or "uh" or person-specific filler words that

Use weights for each of these features to get a score for confience/clarity
